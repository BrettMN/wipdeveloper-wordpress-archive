Next week is Dreamforce.  If you are working in and around the Salesforce ecosystem this probably means something to you.  As a developer one of the things I look forward to is the dev keynote.

As I will not be attending in person this year I thought it would be nice to watch the keynote with other developers, so WIPDeveloper.com will be hosting a [Virtual Dreamforce Dev Keynote Live Stream Party](https://wipdeveloper.wpcomstaging.com/product/lunch-n-learn-virtual-dreamforce-dev-keynote-live-stream-party/) as the September Lunch N' Learn.

Join me Thursday, September 27 from 1:00 p.m. – 2:00 p.m PDT, or 3:00 p.m. – 4:00 p.m CDT, or 8:00 p.m. – 9:00 p.m UTC for  [Virtual Dreamforce Dev Keynote Live Stream Party](https://wipdeveloper.wpcomstaging.com/product/lunch-n-learn-virtual-dreamforce-dev-keynote-live-stream-party/) by registering for free **[HERE](https://wipdeveloper.wpcomstaging.com/product/lunch-n-learn-virtual-dreamforce-dev-keynote-live-stream-party/).**

## That's it for now.
