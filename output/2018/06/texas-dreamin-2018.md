Earlier this month I spent some time down on Texas for [Texas Dreamin' 2018!](https://texasdreamin.org/)

It was another great event by the team that organizes it and I hope to be able to return again next year!

While there I had the honor to present on PWAs with Salesforce. bellow is the description followed by the slides and a link to the code.

## Progressive Web Apps and Salesforce

> Progressive Web Apps, often shortened to PWAs, are a hot new set of buzzwords but aside from sounding fancy what do they mean for you? The concept of a Progressive Web App could be described as a bridge between traditional website and a native application.We’ll take a look at what makes a Progressive Web App, and how to use those features with Salesforce.
