And now for somethings to read (or watch) over the weekend, if you have some spare time that is.

## [Last Shot (Star Wars): A Han and Lando Novel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525622136/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wipdevelope05-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0525622136&linkId=f29b37b2c61d858567f5f26f328eb71b)

Since it's May the 4th I recomend you check out Last Shot.  It have a tale that spans multiple times, from when Lando still had the falcon, when Han has it pre Episode 4, and a few years after Return of the Jedi. It gives insight into Han adapting to being a father along with some of the growing pains with the forming of the New Republic.
