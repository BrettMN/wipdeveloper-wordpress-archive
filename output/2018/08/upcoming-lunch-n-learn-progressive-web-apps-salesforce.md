Next week WIPDeveloper.com will be presenting an online presentation of [Progressive Web Apps && Salesforce](https://wipdeveloper.wpcomstaging.com/product/lunch-n-learn-progressive-web-apps-salesforce/) as part of our new Lunch N' Learn series.  We will be going over the basics of what a Progressive Web App is and one way to implement a Progressive Web App in Salesforce.

There will be slides, there will be code, and there will be time for your questions.

Join me August 16th at 12 CDT for [Progressive Web Apps && Salesforce](https://wipdeveloper.wpcomstaging.com/product/lunch-n-learn-progressive-web-apps-salesforce/) by registering for free **[HERE](https://wipdeveloper.wpcomstaging.com/product/lunch-n-learn-progressive-web-apps-salesforce/).**

## Also

Announcing WIPDeveloper.com Lunch N' Learns!  Free online sessions similar to what you would see at a developer user group or a conference without having to go through airpot security or drive downtown.

All sessions will be recorded and made available through WIPDeveloper.com.   Currently spots are limited so links to sessions will be sent after signing up through the store [**HERE**](https://wipdeveloper.wpcomstaging.com/product-category/lunch-n-learn/).

If you would like to present at a future Lunch N' Learn, or have a suggestion on who I should invite to present,  send me an email (Brett at WIPDeveloper.com) or message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BrettMN)

## That's it for now.
