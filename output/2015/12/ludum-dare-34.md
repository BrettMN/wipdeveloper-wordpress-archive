This past weekend was [Ludum Dare 34](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/12/09/welcome-to-ludum-dare-34/). If you are not familiar with the Ludum Dare, it's a game jam that occurs 3 times a year where participants create a game based on a theme that was voted on leading up the weekend of the event. This time there was a time for two themes, 2 buttons and Growing. Once the theme is announced participants have 72 hours to make a game. There are rules and if you are truly curious about them it would probably be easier to go over to [the rules page](http://ludumdare.com/compo/rules/) and read them there.

Why am I mentioning this? Well I made a **simple** game with TypeScript and the HTML canvas. In fact you can play it here. But first, the rules:

#### The Rules

- Red blocks make you grow
- Green blocks make you shrink
- if you grow as big as the screen the game will be over
- use **a** to move left
- use **s** to move right

##### The game

> It does require a keyboard so... umm if you are on a phone, good luck with that.

If you want to look at the source code for this game it can be found at [GitHub.com/BrettMN/ludumdare-34](https://github.com/BrettMN/ludumdare-34)
