Hey how is everyone doing this week? This week is a short one for me do to the holidays here so I thought I would give any regular readers and update of what happened last week as it seemed a little busy.

#### Microsoft

First up is Microsoft. You may have heard they hosted a virtual conference called [Connect(); //2015](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Visual-Studio/Connect-event-2015/)

> get it? It's named like a function with a comment after it... isn't that clever... any way...

They made a few announcements that seemed interesting to me:

- They open sourced [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) and released a [beta version](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vscode/archive/2015/11/17/announcing-visual-studio-code-beta.aspx) that supports plugins.
- [ASP.Net 5 RC1](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2015/11/18/announcing-asp-net-5-release-candidate-1.aspx) was released as well as a [multiplatform .Net Core](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2015/11/18/announcing-net-core-and-asp-net-5-rc.aspx) with a Go Live liceance. This means you can deploy to Windows or Linux and call Microsoft if you need support.
- [Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-dev-essentials-vs) with offers various benefits including access to partner training, cloud services, and trials to partner services.
- Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 RTM will be available on November 30
- The [Visual Studio Emulator for Android](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/msft-android-emulator-vs.aspx) will be made availiable for Mac OS X.
- Visual Studio Online is being re-branded as [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs.aspx) this is probably because of ===>
- They are adding a Visual Studio Cloud subscription service similar to how Microsoft also offers Office as a subscription through Office 365.

Of course they announced more things but these were the ones that caught my eye at the time of this writing.

#### Aurelia

The team over at [Aurelia.io](Aurelia.io) started off the week by announcing the Beta 1 release of Aurelia. They staged the release over the entire week with blog post covering specific topics as each day.

- [Day 1](http://blog.durandal.io/2015/11/16/aurelia-beta-week-day-1-the-beta-is-here/) - This was the announcement post that talked about community, learning resources and the future roadmap.
- [Day 2](http://blog.durandal.io/2015/11/17/aurelia-beta-week-day-2-plugins/) - The topic of the day was plugins. What are they? What is available? and what do they have planned.
- [Day 3](http://blog.durandal.io/2015/11/18/aurelia-beta-week-day-3-documentation/) - Day 3 was about the new documentation that is available at [Aurelia.io/docs.html](http://aurelia.io/docs.html)
- [Day 4](http://blog.durandal.io/2015/11/19/aurelia-beta-week-day-4-ecosystem/) - The Ecosystem was in the hotseat day 4 covering learing, support and future plans.
- [Day 5](http://blog.durandal.io/2015/11/20/aurelia-beta-week-day-5-aurelia-interface/) - The Aurelia Interface was announced in the last post with a short teaser video and how it fits into Durandal Inc. business plan.

Overall it looks like Aurelia is coming along nicely. The team working on it has done a wonderful job so far.
