Just a quick follow up update for the [Summer Update](/2015/07/21/summer-update/). A recent addition to the site is a [Resource page](/resources/). It's a place to gather resources such as books, podcast, other blogs and other resources that might be useful for a developing developer. If there is a resource that you feel would be a good addition feel free to email suggestions to me at [brett@wipdeveloper.com](mailto:brett@wipdeveloper.com). I will be adding new links as they are suggested or I discover them.
