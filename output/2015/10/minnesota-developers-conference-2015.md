This past week I had the honor of speaking at the Minnesota Developers Conference In Brooklyn Center, Minnesota. This was my first presentation and the sound quality could be better but if you are interested in learning about Aurelia feel free to watch the video. I will also include links to the slides and source code so that you can follow along on your own machine if you would like.
