Thought I would start this off with introducing myself. My name is Brett and I am a software developer in Minnesota with experience in the .Net web stack and a few JavaScript libraries. I thought I would expand my learnings of Microsoft’s technology on the server side and tools for use on the client side and document it here on The WIPDeveloper.com for all the world to see and learn with me or laugh at me depending on how you feel about things.

Why The WIPDeveloper.com? Glad you asked. Much like software, software development skills are ever changing. The only way a software project is ever truly done is after it has become abandonware I think the only time a developers skills need to stop growing is when they have decided to stop developing software.

What to learn first? Well, I guess we’ll find out together in the next post!
