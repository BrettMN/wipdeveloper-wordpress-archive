## Update

If you've been following the wrong with my Lightning Web Components First Look course you'll need to update your CLI to use the Salesforce DX latest version of their plugin. To do that, open up your terminal and type in `sfdx plugins:install salesforcedx`

And we're going to want the latest. So that's `sfdx plugins:install salesforcedx@latest` so we get the latest version of the SalesforceDX plugin.

And I spelled something wrong. Forgot the S.

Try it again.

Wait for this install to download and complete.

We can also run the `sfdx update` command,

Just to make sure everything is up to date.

## That’s all for now.
