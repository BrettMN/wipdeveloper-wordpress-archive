Last month I took a little trip to ATL to attended [Southeast Dreamin' 2019](https://www.southeastdreamin.com/).

It was a great conference to attend and the team that organizes it should be proud.

While there I presented on Salesforce's new ui development model - Lightning Web Components.

## A Quick Intro to Lightning Web Components

> Lighting Web Components are the new, standards based way to create UI elements for Lighting. We will take a quick look at the tools needed to get started and the basics of creating a Lighting Web Component.
