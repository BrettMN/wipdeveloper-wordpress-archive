Hello, I'm Brett with WIPDeveloper.com. Sometimes we would like to change the label as it appears in the app builder layout for the admin.

Rather than having the API name for the component, we can set the label in the metadata file for component to set the label that appears and app builder, we would use the `masterLabele` tag, then we would add the contents that we want for our label.

So this component is named first component. And I would like to say, first component, so that it looks more user friendly to someone who's not as comfortable reading camel case. So I'll say this. Once it same, I will go back and refreshing.

And I now see first component has a space and the first letter of first is capitalized. And we can change it to anything we want. For instance, change the first component ever and says first component ever.

## That’s it for now.
