Hello There!

Some of you may have been wondering where I was last week.  Well it was family vacation time so there wasn't much development getting done.

I'm back and ready to get back to the Salesforce Mobile SDK with Ionic Framework stuff but before I do...

## Vue.js with Salesforce.com

I'm working on something for learning to use Vue.js with Salesforce.com and would greatly appreciate you help.  If you could help me by filling out the following survey it would make it easier to address the needs that I may miss without your input.

> Of course if iframes aren't your thing I understand completely so here is a link to the same survey [Vue.js with Salesforce.com Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/bdFWggC1jHRnCLfJ3)

## Conclusion

Thanks for your time!

Now we can get back to that Mobile SDK stuff.
