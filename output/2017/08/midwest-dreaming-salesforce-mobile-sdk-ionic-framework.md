At Midwest Dreaming I will present/presented on the topic of Salesforce Mobile SDK and Ionic Framework.  Here you will find the source code, any questions that I may have missed and had to look up later and maybe even a slide or 2 after I make sure that's ok to share.

## Source Code

Source code can be found on Github at [Github.com/BrettMN/midwest-dreamin-demo-app](https://github.com/BrettMN/midwest-dreamin-demo-app).

## Slides

Coming Soon!

## Video of Creating Working Project

Here is the video that was part of the presentation of getting a project created with the Salesforce Mobile SDK working with the Ionic Framework.  It's at 4 times speed.

## Unanswered Questions

- Does using the Salesforce Mobile SDK count against API limits.
    - If you are creating a local hybrid app yes it does.
    - If you create a remote hybrid app you can use remote actions and it does not.

I think there may have been a few more questions I did not have answers too.  If you were there and would be so kind to remind me or if you have one of your own please let me know in a comment bellow or through email/twitter.
