Let's try something new. I'm going to share a few things that I saw that were interesting from around the web the past few days. So here we go:

## [A cartoon intro to WebAssembly](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/)

This past week the four major browsers [announced](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webassembly/2017Feb/0002.html) the end of browser preview for WebAssembly. This means browsers can start shipping with WebAssembly turned on by default. With that in mind this story may help you get a better understanding of what WebAssembly is if you aren't already familiar. And it has cartoons, we call that a win-win.

## [Strike by Appiphony](http://www.lightningstrike.io/)

Have you every been looking something up about the [Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/) and wanted to get a better sense of what attributes to set? Well [strike](http://www.lightningstrike.io/) is for you! It has a set of components for use and it open source. I think the real treat though is the preview feature. You can select a component, Strike or base Lightening, and see live updates to a sample and the necessary markup.

## [Summary of the Amazon S3 Service Disruption](https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/)

If you use the internet at all there is a chance that you some sites or services you used on February 28 were degraded or disrupted altogether. Amazons AWS S3 Service had an issue caused by "one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly". It explains what happened as well as why the AWS Service Health Dashboard wasn't updating with the issue.

## [A Link: rel=preload Analysis From the Chrome Data Saver Team](https://medium.com/reloading/a-link-rel-preload-analysis-from-the-chrome-data-saver-team-5edf54b08715#.g8qby7xt7)

Looking for a way to optimize page load bottle necks with related to resource loading. This article may help some. It describes the benefits of using `link rel=”preload”` and some things to consider when/if doing so.

## That's All for Now
