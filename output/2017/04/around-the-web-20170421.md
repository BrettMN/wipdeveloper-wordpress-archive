And now for somethings to read over the weekend, if you have some spare time that is.

## [Why Running 237km in Sahara and Being a Salesforce Dev is Exactly the Same](http://www.nlikane.com/2017/04/why-running-237km-in-sahara-and-being.html?m=1)

Lets start it off with this. Nick ran 237 km through Sahara over 6-7 days. That's almost 150 miles for people like me who don't metric so well. Great read on comparisons too. I may have troubles with #7 sometimes.

## [Augmented Reality in 10 Lines of HTML](https://dev.to/andraconnect/augmented-reality-in-10-lines-of-html)

Augmented Reality is the the hot new, and by new I mean well Facebook demoed some progress on it this past week and Hololens by Microsoft has been out for a but now. So now you can make you can make an AR html app in 10, yes 10!, lines of code! Take a look if you don't believe me.

## [Selector](https://github.com/Websilk/Selector)

Selector is a "A micro JavaScript library used as a replacement for jQuery, weighing in at nearly 5KB." That's 5KB gzipped but still. It has support for many function that jQuery provides so if you are conscious about the "weight" of your page but don't want to write your own you could give this a try.

## [Mini.css](https://chalarangelo.github.io/mini.css/)

Mini.css is a "minimal, responsive, style-agnostic CSS framework". It is rather small in size, 7KB gzipped, and has what looks like most of the CSS features that would be needed to have as a base for styling a site.

## [How I built a responsive & semantic "Contact Me" page in under 16KB](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2017/04/how-i-built-a-responsive-semantic-contact-me-page-in-under-16kb/)

There seems to be a theme this week with size. So why not checkout this contact page done in under 16KB gziped! That's like smaller than a business card.

## [SWCO 2017: 10 THINGS WE LEARNED FROM THE STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI PANEL](http://www.starwars.com/news/swco-2017-10-things-we-learned-from-the-star-wars-the-last-jedi-panel?cmp=smc%7C861241074)

Star Wars!
