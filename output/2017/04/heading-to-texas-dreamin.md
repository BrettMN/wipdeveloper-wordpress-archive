Hey there! How are things going? I just wanted to make a quick announcement, I am going to take a quick trip down I35[1](1) to Austin Texas for [Texas Dreamin'](http://texasdreamin.org/) May 11th and 12th!

## Talks by Others

The scheduled hasn't been announced yet but I hear there will be talks by:

- [Gaurav Kheterpal](https://twitter.com/gauravkheterpal)
- [Shonnah](https://twitter.com/SaaSy_Sistah) blog @ [SaasySistah.com](http://saasysistah.com/)
- [Stephen Noe](https://twitter.com/SNoeCloud) blog @ [StephenNoe.com](http://www.stephennoe.com/)
- [Roger Mitchell](https://twitter.com/RogerMitchell) blog @ [Medium.com/@rogermitchell](https://medium.com/@rogermitchell)
- some guy calling himself "[John De Santiago](https://twitter.com/johndesantiago)" blog @ [Iterativelogic.com](http://www.iterativelogic.com/) and half of the podcast @ [Good Day, Sir! Show](http://www.gooddaysirpodcast.com/).

I am sure there will be other speakers but I'm getting tired of looking through twitter for speakers :)

## Shameless Self Promotion

Oh yeah, not only will I be attending but the good folks organizing have selected me to present **Introduction to ECMAScript 2015+** and **Angular, Visualforce, and You**! So if you have been thinking about tipping your toes into some of the newer features waters of JavaScript or just dying to try Angular[2](2) in a Salesforce environment maybe you should [register now](http://texasdreamin.org/1103-2).

## That is All

If you are going to be there what are you interested in seeing? Drop me a note at [brett@wipdeveloper.com](mailto:brett@wipdeveloper.com) or by leaving a comment below.

1. Ok, so maybe I wont take I35 since it will be a lot quicker to fly. [↩](1 "return to article")
2. Angular aka the framework formerly known as Angular 2 [↩](2 "return to article")
