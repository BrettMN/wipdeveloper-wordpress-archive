[Getting Naked: A Business Fable About Shedding The Three Fears That Sabotage Client Loyalty](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787976393/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wipdevelope05-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0787976393&linkId=de88f5628724e73a44d5b2338a04144c) by Patrick Lencioni is a story of a guy coming to understanding a different way of interacting with his clients.

## Overall

The book is told from the perspective of Jack Bauer who has spent years working at a large consulting firm in the San Francisco bay area. the story begins with him being tasked with assessing a recent acquisition his firm made and to best see how/if it can be incorporated into the current business structure. Through the course of learning about the smaller firm that was acquired Jack also learns about how they conduct business.

Most of the book is about Jack attempting to understand how this smaller firm does business. He eventually identifies 3 fears that hold people back: the Fear of Losing the Business, Fear of Being Embarrassed, and Fear of Feeling Inferior. The book also has ways to deal with these fears but you should probably read the book if you want to get those as you will gain more from it than a bullet point list.

I think that these 3 fears apply in more areas than just the business consulting environment the book is set in. After all anyone who has had a moment of doubt has probably felt all three fears.
