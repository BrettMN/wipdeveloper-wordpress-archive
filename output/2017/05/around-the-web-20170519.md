And now for somethings to read over the weekend, if you have some spare time that is.

## [Salesforce created an algorithm that automatically summarizes text using machine learning](https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/14/15637588/salesforce-algorithm-automatically-summarizes-text-machine-learning-ai)

Salesforce created an "AI" to create TLDRs. I should see if I can use it for these teaser paragraphs...

## [Create an Animated Sticky Navigation Menu with Vanilla JavaScript](https://www.sitepoint.com/animated-sticky-navigation-menu-javascript/)

Here is a nice little article on creating a sticky navigation on a webpage without a JavaScript library. Worth a look if you are into that sort of thing.

## [Increase Your Velocity with Continuous Deployment for Salesforce](https://bluecanvas.io/2016/07/26/continuous-deployment-for-salesforce.html)

This is from last summer but if your new to Continuous Delivery or Continuous Integration it's a great read. Even if you don't plan on using Blue Canvas as it contains explanations for things that will come up in conversation

## [About Those Spinoffs...](http://grrm.livejournal.com/536859.html)

If you are a fan of [A Song of Fire and Ice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345535529/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wipdevelope05-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0345535529&linkId=a34ebcd0dc1924236f5a391253225d49) or [Game of Thrones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H2JPULU/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wipdevelope05-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01H2JPULU&linkId=b3df8f8242071921879746fdbc8d1a9a) for you tv viewers. There were some rumors of spin off shows. Here GRRM addresses those Rumors and confirms he is still writing Winds of Winter.

## [ICZI USB 2.0 Type A to Type C (USB to USB-C)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01G5CLLIQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wipdevelope05-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01G5CLLIQ&linkId=c853cf9c82de2ca6d5d3bc4f10327834)

Last week while traveling to [Texas Dreamin'](/2017/05/15/texas-dreamin-2017/) I brought a [Nintendo Switch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LTHP2ZK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wipdevelope05-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01LTHP2ZK&linkId=3c969376981dcdf8d220fb1dfba801de). While [Zelda](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MS6MO77/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wipdevelope05-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01MS6MO77&linkId=d9b6ae21f6e09c09697d0539950ce47a) is fun to play it would not have been that fun if the power ran out. The [ICZI USB 2.0 Type A to Type C (USB to USB-C)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01G5CLLIQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wipdevelope05-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01G5CLLIQ&linkId=c853cf9c82de2ca6d5d3bc4f10327834) allowed me to charge off of the [battery pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VWV8LD4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wipdevelope05-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00VWV8LD4&linkId=aa0562f7010bd8cd91595d9eefaf10ff) I already had.
