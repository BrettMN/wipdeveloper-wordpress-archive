Hello Again!  What have you been up to?  I thought I would stop for a moment and let you know I will be taking a bit of a trip over to Chicago Illinois for [Midwest Dreamin'](http://midwestdreamin.com/) August 10th and 11th!

## Talks!

I think they are updating the site to include the talks next week but I have seen a couple people on Twiter mention they are tlaking

- [Roger Mitchell](https://twitter.com/RogerMitchell) blog @ [Medium.com/@rogermitchell](https://medium.com/@rogermitchell)
- [Carla Llewellyn](https://twitter.com/carla_kay__c) mentioned a talk titled "Take Your Admin Skills to the Next Level - Intro to the Dev Console"
- [Joseph Fiega](https://twitter.com/jfiega) and [Mike Martin](https://twitter.com/mikemartin__c) have [mentioned](https://twitter.com/jfiega/status/870300374544134144) talking about earn about value propositions and implementation strategies for Lightning Experience
    

We will have to wait till the schedule is posted on the site to find out the rest

## Shameless Self Promotion Time

Besides going to see these other awesome speakers the great folks arranging the event have chosen a talk by none other than yours truly.  Titled **Salesforce Mobile Sdk and Ionic** we will take a look at the challenges of getting started using the Salesforce Mobile Sdk with the Ionic Framework!

## Tickets

As of the time of this writing there are still some early bird tickets left or there were a couple of days ago.  So go **[register](http://midwestdreamin.com/#tile_registration)**!
