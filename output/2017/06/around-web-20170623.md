## [linter-lightning](https://atom.io/packages/linter-lightning)

Use Atom?  This plugin provides access to  [the Lightning Linter in the Heroku Toolbelt](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/cli_intro.htm).  You need the Heroku CLI toolbelt installed already but hey you can get that pretty easily :)

## [Westinghouse AA NI-MH 2000MAH Rechargeable Batteries](http://amzn.to/2t5C5WB)

I have a [Logitech MX Master Wireless Mouse](http://amzn.to/2rMGnyb) and aside from some scrolling issues it works ok.  Lately I have been having to recharge it almost every day and at that point it might as well be a wired mouse.  Then I realized I could change the battery!  So I replaced it with one of these instead of getting a new mouse.
