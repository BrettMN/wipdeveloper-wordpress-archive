It's that time of the year when people are retrospective about the previous year and at the same time resolving affect positive changes in oneself. As a software developer one way we can help ourselves improve by learning, or refreshing, concepts or principles that apply to multiple languages.

Last year on Kickstarter you could back a project to produce a [Software Craftsmanship calendar](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/988315286/software-craftsmanship-calendar-2016/description). And while the Kickstarter campaign is long over the concepts that are displayed in the calendar are still relevant and you can pick up the calendar on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017F7SQ74/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B017F7SQ74&linkCode=as2&tag=wipdevelcom-20&linkId=JU5VAKEEWWBBP2FS).

Granted this would have probably been a little better to share before Christmas but then again it's never too late to get yourself a gift.

#### Conclusion

The calendar covers important software craftsmanship topics such as [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) accompanied with humorous pictures that help illustrate the topics.
