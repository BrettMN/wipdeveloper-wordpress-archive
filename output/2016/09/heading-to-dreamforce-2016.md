Hey guess what! I'm going to [Dreamforce 2016](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF16/) to present on JavaScript. My session is part of the developer track and titled [Introduction to ECMAScript 6](https://success.salesforce.com/Sessions#/session/a2q3A000000LBSSQA4). What does this mean for you dear reader? Well I think it means that my little hiatus is going to have to come to an end as I prepare content for the talk.

So, if you happen to be in San Francisco in early October and already have a ticket to the show, stop by my presentation for an Introduction to ECMAScript 6[1](1).

If you are going to be there what are you interested in seeing? Drop me a note at [brett@wipdeveloper.com](mailto:brett@wipdeveloper.com) or by leaving a comment below.

1. Maybe we'll let every one know at the end that there's a ES7 (officially titled [ECMAScript 2016](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html)). [â†©](1 "return to article")
